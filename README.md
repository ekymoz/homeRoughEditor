# homeRoughEditor Version 0.93

Help me to make this project an essential and free resource for all, so that any developer / integrator can propose to create **_plans for house_, _apartment_**, etc. online. **Full Javascript**, No external library without an old Jquery (only for Bootstrap), Boostrap 3 and FontAwesome. For cons, forgive me for my English, it is very rusty !!!

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

You just have to copy the files into a directory and open the index.html file in your browser. Version 0.93 of homeRoughtEditor is operational from **Mozilla 39!**

### See example

## Running the tests

Personally I only test all this with the mozilla debug console

## TODO
- Make TouchScreen functions for tablet (or smartphone, but too tiny screen i think...)
- Make interoperability for browsers (actually good for Moz.)
- Refine the CSS and buttons behavior
- Refine the Historical system (use LocalStorage)
- Complete the translation (i'm French) 
- Make your own system/functions to export plan to any database 

## Built With

* [Atom.io](https://atom.io/) - My code editor. Simple and free.
* [Bootstrap](getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/) - Bootstrap, a sleek, intuitive, and powerful mobile first front-end framework for faster and easier web development.
